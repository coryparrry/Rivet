# Configuration

Rivet writes adopter-owned policy to `.github/rivet.json`. Schema v4 is closed:
unknown or missing fields fail validation. Start with the guided installer:

```bash
npx @coryparry/rivet init
```

The default policy enables automatic pull-request review and incoming issue
triage. Maintenance, repair, issue implementation, and merge remain disabled by
default.

## Refreshing an installation

Bare `rivet init` resolves the repository root when run from any directory
inside the checkout. Explicit modes use the current directory unless
`--repository` supplies the root. Both paths read an existing
`.github/rivet.json` from the selected root before rendering workflows. Flags
such as `--issues` and `--maintenance` update only the named setting; custom
model choices, review limits, and all other valid settings are preserved.
Explicit `--repair` likewise preserves the existing policy while changing
`repair.authority` to `owner`.

Guided review setup refuses to silently downgrade an existing repair
installation. Refresh that installation with `rivet init --repair --setup-pr`.
The installer accepts only current managed output or a supported frozen prior
baseline, and it refuses to overwrite an adopter edit. Semantically equivalent
compiled YAML locks keep their existing bytes, so compiler comments or
formatting alone do not create setup-PR churn.

## Maintenance reports

Enable a report manually or weekly when installing:

```bash
npx @coryparry/rivet init --review-only --maintenance scheduled --setup-pr
```

Use `manual` instead of `scheduled` to omit the weekly trigger. The
`repository-auditor` identity runs against the exact frozen default-branch
snapshot and emits a validated JSON artifact plus receipt. It is report-only:
it cannot create an issue, pull request, comment, commit, label, or merge, and
it needs no GitHub App permission. It uses the configured `models.review`
engine and model (Codex `gpt-5.6-luna` by default). An incomplete report is
retained as incomplete; it is never treated as a clean audit.
Use `--maintenance disabled` to remove an existing Rivet-owned maintenance
workflow through the same verified installation path.

## Issue controls

`issues.triage` currently supports two installable modes:

- `automatic` installs incoming issue triage for newly opened issues and
  authorized follow-up replies. Rivet records its unresolved questions in its
  App-authored comment, then supplies that bounded state and the subsequent
  conversation when it reassesses the issue. It cannot label, close,
  implement, open a pull request, or merge.
- `disabled` installs no issue-triage workflow. Pull-request review cannot
  defer a finding to a new issue, and the GitHub App needs no Issues
  permission.

Automatic triage also lets a pull-request review defer at most one verified,
out-of-scope finding to a new issue. Deferral creates the issue; incoming
triage publishes one state for a newly opened issue and a new state after each
authorized follow-up. They are separate actions governed by the same
permission, and neither authorizes implementation.

Pull-request review context includes a bounded set of exact-head source blobs
and prior Rivet reviews and inline comments. Historical content is treated as
untrusted memory: the current comparison and verified blob identity remain the
authority for findings, duplicate suppression, and deferral.

Enabling automatic triage requires GitHub App Issues: write. Existing App
installations may require explicit approval from a GitHub administrator before
the new permission takes effect. `issues.implementation` must remain
`disabled`; Rivet does not install an issue implementation workflow.

## Other controls

| Setting                  | Current behavior                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `review.automatic`       | Runs review and reconciles its four managed labels on eligible pull requests. |
| `review.inlineFindings`  | Allows bounded inline review comments.                                        |
| `review.requestChanges`  | Chooses comment-only or request-changes review.                               |
| `review.maximumFindings` | Limits findings to an integer from 1 to 20.                                   |
| `repair.authority`       | `never` by default; `owner` requires the separate repair authority upgrade.   |
| `maintenance.mode`       | `disabled`, `manual`, or weekly `scheduled`; report-only in enabled modes.    |
| `merge.authority`        | Must remain `never`.                                                          |

The `models.review` engine, model, and effort are also used for incoming issue
triage. The current default is Codex with `gpt-5.6-luna` and `default` effort.
Codex also accepts an optional `endpoint` containing `baseUrl` and
`apiKeySecret` for Responses-compatible providers such as DeepSeek. See
[custom model endpoints](RIVET_SCHEMA_V4.md#custom-model-endpoints) for the
configuration, credential setup and protocol requirements.
After context preparation, an eligible review clears stale Rivet status and
test labels and applies `review needed`, including when no review snapshot is
available. After successful current-head review publication, Rivet replaces
that pending state with one of
`changes required`, `review needed`, or `merge ready`, plus `needs tests` only
for a concrete missing deterministic test. All other repository labels are
left unchanged.

See [schema v4](RIVET_SCHEMA_V4.md) for the complete JSON shape and
[GitHub App authority](RIVET_GITHUB_APP_AUTHORITY.md) for permissions.
