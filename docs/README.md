# Rivet documentation

Rivet is the active package and workflow system. Its architecture, configuration,
and delivery gates are documented here. The completed gh-aw migration decisions
remain in [RIVET_GH_AW_MIGRATION.md](RIVET_GH_AW_MIGRATION.md), with the legacy
comparison checkpoint in [RIVET_LEGACY_BASELINE.md](RIVET_LEGACY_BASELINE.md).
The compiler-boundary self-review result is recorded in
[RIVET_GH_AW_TRUST_PROOF.md](RIVET_GH_AW_TRUST_PROOF.md).

Start with installation for local evaluation, then review configuration,
architecture, and authority before enabling any workflow. The legacy
Codekeeper release process is retired.
