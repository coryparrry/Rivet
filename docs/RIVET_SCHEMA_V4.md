# Rivet configuration schema v4

Rivet configuration describes product intent rather than gh-aw implementation
details. The installer writes `.github/rivet.json` with the closed schema v4
surface and rejects unknown fields.

## Review-only default

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 4,
  "review": {
    "automatic": true,
    "inlineFindings": true,
    "requestChanges": false,
    "maximumFindings": 8
  },
  "repair": { "authority": "never" },
  "issues": { "triage": "automatic", "implementation": "disabled" },
  "maintenance": { "mode": "disabled" },
  "merge": { "authority": "never" },
  "models": {
    "review": {
      "engine": "codex",
      "model": "gpt-5.6-luna",
      "effort": "default"
    }
  }
}
```

The installer converts these controls into a product-authority summary before
rendering. The compiled workflow is then inspected separately and must remain
within that declared authority.

`review.automatic` includes Rivet's fixed review-state labels. An eligible run
first applies `review needed`. Successful review publication then selects one
of `changes required`, `review needed`, or `merge ready`, with `needs tests`
only for a concrete missing deterministic test. These names and transitions are
product behavior rather than additional schema fields, and labels outside this
managed set are preserved.

## Engine projection

| Engine  | Model                   | Effort         |
| ------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| Codex   | Top-level gh-aw `model` | `default` only |
| Claude  | Top-level gh-aw `model` | `default` only |
| Copilot | Top-level gh-aw `model` | `default` only |
| Gemini  | Top-level gh-aw `model` | `default` only |

The schema recognizes explicit effort values so future migrations can report
them, but the pinned gh-aw v0.86.2 renderer rejects them. Its engine arguments
are also applied to threat detection and can produce an invalid detection
command, so Rivet does not silently approximate this setting.

`review.maximumFindings` accepts integers from 1 to 20. The trust inspection
allows the compiler output to vary at the exact prompt, tool metadata, Safe
Output, handler, and generated-script occurrences of that requested limit. The
compiled limit must equal the configuration value; all other compiled
authority remains digest-bound to the approved workflow shape.

Rivet does not recreate provider SDKs or expose arbitrary engine configuration.
Advanced upstream features remain native gh-aw imports until Rivet promotes a
stable product-level control.

## Custom model endpoints

Codex accepts an optional `models.review.endpoint` object with exactly two
fields: `baseUrl` and `apiKeySecret`. Existing schema-v4 configurations do not
need this object. For example, replace the `models.review` value with:

```json
{
  "engine": "codex",
  "model": "deepseek-v4-flash",
  "effort": "default",
  "endpoint": {
    "baseUrl": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
    "apiKeySecret": "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

The endpoint must support the Codex Responses API, including streaming and tool
calls. OpenAI Chat Completions compatibility alone is insufficient. Model
discovery must advertise the configured model at `<basePath>/models`, or
`/v1/models` when the base URL has no path. The pinned compiler's separate
threat-detection proxy retains its upstream model selection behavior.
The model must also have pricing in the
[pinned proxy's catalog](https://github.com/github/gh-aw-firewall/blob/v0.27.44/containers/api-proxy/models.dev.catalog.json): its credit
budget rejects unknown model names with `unknown_model_ai_credits`, even if
the provider advertises them. Custom pricing is not configurable here.
The documented DeepSeek v4 model names are catalogued. DeepSeek documents its
[Codex integration](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/codex/).

`baseUrl` accepts an HTTPS DNS URL on the default HTTPS port, with an optional
path. Credentials, query strings, fragments, IP addresses, encoded path segments
and shell expressions are rejected. `apiKeySecret` is an uppercase GitHub
Actions secret name, never the key value. GitHub access tokens and Rivet App
credentials cannot be selected as model credentials.

Rivet maps that secret to both Codex credential variables, adds the endpoint's
exact hostname to the workflow network policy, and passes the endpoint to the
main and threat-detection runs. The main agent's proxy model fallback and token
steering are disabled. Review, issue triage, enabled maintenance and
owner-authorized repair use the custom endpoint and configured model.

Store the key using `gh secret set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, then run
`rivet init --review-only --dry-run` to inspect the workflow changes.
Run `rivet init --review-only` to apply them locally, and commit the configuration
and generated files together. Use the corresponding `--repair` commands for an
existing repair installation.
For the setup-PR route, first merge the configuration into the default branch
and synchronize the local checkout to that exact remote commit, then run
`rivet init --review-only --setup-pr`.
Guided `rivet init` also recognizes and can store the configured secret.
Changing or removing the endpoint regenerates recognized managed workflows;
unrecognized local workflow modifications still block an overwrite.

The endpoint control currently requires `engine: "codex"`. Live provider
authentication and an adopter Actions run remain separate from local compiler
verification.

## Issue boundary

`issues.triage` may be `automatic` or `disabled` for an installation.
Automatic mode has two separate bounded effects: it installs a workflow that
may add one App-authored state to a newly opened issue and a new state after an
authorized reporter or collaborator follow-up, and it lets a pull-request
review defer at most one verified, out-of-scope finding to a new issue. Neither
path implements the issue.

Disabled mode installs no issue-triage workflow, disables review deferral, and
requires no GitHub App Issues permission. Enabling automatic triage requires
Issues: write; an existing installation may require explicit GitHub admin
approval for that permission change. `issues.implementation` must remain
`disabled`.

## Remaining boundary

Maintenance report runs are manual or weekly, use the repository-auditor
identity, and emit only a validated JSON artifact plus receipt. They do not
create an issue, pull request, comment, commit, label, or merge and require no
GitHub App permission. Incoming issue triage and pull-request deferral remain
separate capabilities: triage publishes bounded states for newly opened issues
and authorized follow-ups, while deferral creates an issue for a verified
out-of-scope pull-request finding. Neither authorizes implementation.

Schema v4 can represent a future owner-authorized issue implementation mode;
the current installer rejects it. Repair is a separate explicit authority
upgrade. Merge authority has only one accepted value: `never`.
